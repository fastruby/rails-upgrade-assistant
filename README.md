# RailsUpgradeAssistant

This gem helps you plan your Ruby On Rails upgrade by injecting code into the core modules to print extra warnings and message for future Rails versions that may not be documented and also for versions past the next one.

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_upgrade_assistant', github: "fastruby/rails-upgrade-assistant"
```

Then run your test suite or your app locally and check the output.
